                Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded by Zeno
                of Citium in Athens in the early 3rd century BC. It is a
                philosophy of personal ethics informed by its system of logic
                and its views on the natural world. According to its teachings,
                as social beings, the path to eudaimonia (happiness, or
                blessedness) is found in accepting the moment as it presents
                itself, by not allowing oneself to be controlled by the desire
                for pleasure or by the fear of pain, by using one's mind to
                understand the world and to do one's part in nature's plan, and
                by working together and treating others fairly and justly.

                  The Stoics are especially known for teaching that "virtue is
                  the only good" for human beings, and those external
                  things—such as health, wealth, and pleasure—are not good or
                  bad in themselves (adiaphora), but have value as "material for
                  virtue to act upon." Alongside Aristotelian ethics, the Stoic
                  tradition forms one of the major founding approaches to virtue
                  ethics.The Stoics also held that certain destructive emotions
                  resulted from errors of judgment, and they believed people
                  should aim to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is "in
                  accordance with nature." Because of this, the Stoics thought
                  the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what
                  a person said but how a person behaved.To live a good life,
                  one had to understand the rules of the natural order since
                  they thought everything was rooted in nature.

                  Many Stoics—such as Seneca and Epictetus—emphasized that
                  because "virtue is sufficient for happiness," a sage would be
                  emotionally resilient to misfortune. This belief is similar to
                  the meaning of the phrase "stoic calm," though the phrase does
                  not include the "radical ethical" Stoic views that only a sage
                  can be considered truly free and that all moral corruptions
                  are equally vicious.
