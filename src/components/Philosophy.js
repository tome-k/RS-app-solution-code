          <h2>Philosophy of stoicism</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Stoicism </strong>is a school of Hellenistic philosophy
            founded by Zeno of Citium in Athens in the early 3rd century BC. It
            is a philosophy of personal ethics informed by its system of logic
            and its views on the natural world. According to its teachings, as
            social beings, the path to eudaimonia (happiness, or blessedness) is
            found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not allowing
            oneself to be controlled by the desire for pleasure or by the fear
            of pain, by using one's mind to understand the world and to do one's
            part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others
            fairly and justly.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The Stoics </strong>are especially known for teaching that
            "virtue is the only good" for human beings, and those external
            things—such as health, wealth, and pleasure—are not good or bad in
            themselves (adiaphora), but have value as "material for virtue to
            act upon." Alongside Aristotelian ethics, the Stoic tradition forms
            one of the major founding approaches to virtue ethics.The Stoics
            also held that certain destructive emotions resulted from errors of
            judgment, and they believed people should aim to maintain a will
            (called prohairesis) that is "in accordance with nature." Because of
            this, the Stoics thought the best indication of an individual's
            philosophy was not what a person said but how a person behaved.To
            live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural
            order since they thought everything was rooted in nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Many </strong>Stoics—such as Seneca and Epictetus—emphasized
            that because "virtue is sufficient for happiness," a sage would be
            emotionally resilient to misfortune. This belief is similar to the
            meaning of the phrase "stoic calm," though the phrase does not
            include the "radical ethical" Stoic views that only a sage can be
            considered truly free and that all moral corruptions are equally
            vicious.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Stoicism</strong> flourished throughout the Roman and Greek
            world until the 3rd century AD, and among its adherents was Emperor
            Marcus Aurelius. It experienced a decline after Christianity became
            the state religion in the 4th century AD. Since then it has seen
            revivals, notably in the Renaissance (Neostoicism) and in the
            contemporary era (modern Stoicism).
